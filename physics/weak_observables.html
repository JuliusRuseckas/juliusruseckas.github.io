  <h3>Probability density</h3>
  <p>
  Taking the operator \(A\) in the
  <a href="weak_measurements.html">weak measurements</a>
  as a projection operator \(\hat{P}_a=|a\rangle\langle a|\) we can determine
  the probability of finding the quantum system in the state \(|a\rangle\):
  \[
  P_a=|\langle a|\psi\rangle|^2
  =\langle\hat{P}_a\rangle=\frac{1}{\gamma\tau}(\langle q'\rangle-\langle q\rangle)\,.
  \]
  In particular, for \(\hat{P}_x=|x\rangle\langle x|\) weak measurements
  can determine the probability density \(\rho(x)=|\psi(x)|^{2}\).
  </p>

  <h3>Probability current</h3>
  <p>
  The SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the wave function leads to the equation
  of continuity 
  \[
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rho(x,t)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}j(x,t)=0\,,
  \]
  where \(\rho(x,t)=|\psi(x,t)|^2\) is the probability density and
  \(j(x,t)\) is the probability current. From the continuity equation
  it follows
  \[
  j(X,t)=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int_{X}^{\infty}\rho(x,t)\,\mathrm{d}x\,.
  \]
  The quantity
  \[
  \int_X^{\infty}\rho(x,t)\,\mathrm{d}x=\langle\psi(t)|\hat{P}_X|\psi(t)\rangle
  \]
  is the probability to find a quantum system in the spatial region
  \(x>X\). Here
  \[
  \hat{P}_X = \Theta(\hat{x}-X)
  \]
  is the projection operator on the subspace \(x>X\) and \(\Theta\) is
  the Heaviside unit-step function. Approximating the time derivative
  by a finite difference we get
  \[
  j(X,t)=\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}\left(\langle\hat{P}_X(t+\Delta t)\rangle-\langle\hat{P}_X(t)\rangle\right)
  \approx\frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(\langle\hat{P}_X(t+\Delta t)\rangle-\langle\hat{P}_X(t)\rangle\right)\,.
  \]
  Since the weak measurements do not disturb the time evolution of the
  quantum system, we can measure both averages \(\langle\hat{P}_X (t)\rangle\)
  and \(\langle\hat{P}_X (t+\Delta t)\rangle\) using weak measurements
  where the quantum system interacts with two detectors at times \(t\)
  and \(t+\Delta t\). Alternatively, one can use a single detector with
  time dependent interaction strength \(\gamma\): the interaction is
  briefly switched on at times \(t\) and \(t+\Delta t\) with the change
  of the sign of interaction strength, \(\gamma(t+\Delta t)=-\gamma(t)\).
  </p>

  <h3>Dwell time</h3>
  <p>
  Let us consider a state \(|\psi(t)\rangle\) of a quantum system that
  evolves in time. In the ordinary quantum mechanics there is no general
  method for the determination of durations. We can define a <i>dwell time</i>
  <a href="#1">[1]</a> in the state \(|a\rangle\) as
  \[
  \tau_{\mathrm{Dw}}(T)=\int_0^T |\langle a|\psi(t)\rangle|^2\,\mathrm{d}t\,.
  \]
  The dwell time can be interpreted as a duration of time that the system
  spends in the state $|a\rangle$ before time \(T\). As a particular
  case, for spatial region between coordinates \(x_1\) and \(x_2\)
  the dwell time is
  \[
  \tau_{\mathrm{Dw}}(T)=\int_0^T\mathrm{d}t\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\mathrm{d}x\,|\psi(x,t)|^2\,.
  \]
  We will show that the dwell time can be measured using weak measurements.
  </p>
  <p>
  If the interaction strenght is small, to obtain meaningful information
  about the quantum system the process of interaction has to be performed
  on an ensemble of identical quantum systems. Each system with its
  own detector is prepared in the same initial state, interacts with
  the detector, and after the interaction time \(T\) the readings of
  the detectors are collected and averaged. Let us consider the time
  evolution of the quantum system together with the microscopic part
  of the detector. This time evolution is described by the Hamiltonian
  \[
  H=H_{\mathrm{S}}+H_{\mathrm{I}}\,.
  \]
  Here \(H_{\mathrm{S}}\) is the Hamiltonian of the quantum system and
  \[
  H_{\mathrm{I}}=\gamma p_q\hat{P}_a
  \]
  describes the interaction with the detector as in a
  <a href="simple_measurement.html">simple von Neumann measurement</a>.
  The operator
  \[
  \hat{P}_a=|a\rangle\langle a|
  \]
  is the projection operator projecting into the sate \(|a\rangle\),
  \(p_q\) is the momentum of the detector conjugate to the coordinate
  of the detector \(q\), and the parameter \(\gamma\) describes the strength
  of the interaction. In order to not disturb the evolution of the quantum
  system, the parameter \(\gamma\) is very small. The interaction Hamiltonian
  \(H_{\mathrm{I}}\) results in a small shift of the detector's position
  \(q\). If the initial state of the detector has a width much larger
  than this shift, the evolution of the quantum system is only slightly
  disturbed.
  </p>
  <p>
  From the classical point of view, the change of the detector's position
  is proportional to the duration of time that the quantum system spends
  in the state \(|a\rangle\). It is natural to extend the classical method
  of the determination of the duration into the quantum mechanics too.
  Therefore we assume that the change of the mean coordinate of the
  detector is proportional to the time that the quantum system interacts
  with the detector and this interaction time is the same as the time
  the system spends in the state \(|a\rangle\). Thus we can define the
  duration of time that the quantum system spends in the state \(|a\rangle\)
  before time \(T\) as
  \[
  \tau(T)=\frac{1}{\gamma}(\langle q(T)\rangle-\langle q\rangle)\,,
  \]
  where \(\langle q\rangle\) and \(\langle q(T)\rangle\) are the mean
  initial detector's coordinate and the mean coordinate after time \(T\).
  We will show that such definition gives us the dwell time.
  </p>
  <p>
  Before the interaction the detector is in the pure state \(|\phi\rangle\)
  and the quantum system in the state \(|\psi(0)\rangle\), thus the initial
  state of system and the detector is
  \[
  |\Psi(0)\rangle=|\psi(0)\rangle|\phi\rangle\,.
  \]
  At time \(t\) the state becomes
  \[
  |\Psi(t)\rangle=U(t)|\psi(0)\rangle|\phi\rangle\,,
  \]
  where \(U(t)\) is the unitary evolution operator obeying the equation
  \[
  \mathrm{i}\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}U(t)=(H_{\mathrm{S}}+H_{\mathrm{I}})U(t)
  \]
  with the initial condition \(U(0)=I\). The time evolution of the unperturbed
  quantum system is described by the evolution operator \(U_{\mathrm{S}}(t)\)
  obeying the equation
  \[
  \mathrm{i}\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}U_{\mathrm{S}}(t)=H_{\mathrm{S}}U_{\mathrm{S}}(t)\,.
  \]
  We can expand the operator \(U(t)\) into the power series of the powers
  of parameter \(\gamma\), assuming that \(\gamma\) is small. Introducting
  the projection operator in the interaction representation
  \[
  \tilde{P}_a(t)=U_{\mathrm{S}}^{\dagger}(t)\hat{P}_a U_{\mathrm{S}}(t)
  \]
  in the first-order approximation we have
  \[
  U(t)\approx U_{\mathrm{S}}(t)\left(1-\frac{\mathrm{i}}{\hbar}\gamma p_q
  \int_0^t\tilde{P}_a(t')\,\mathrm{d}t'\right)\,.
  \]
  As a consequence,
  \[
  \langle q|U(t)|\psi\rangle|\phi\rangle
  \approx|\psi(t)\rangle\langle q|\phi\rangle
  -\frac{\mathrm{i}}{\hbar}\gamma\langle q|p_q|\phi\rangle
  \int_0^t\mathrm{d}t'\,U_{\mathrm{S}}(t-t')\hat{P}_a|\psi(t')\rangle\,.
  \]
  The duration of the interaction with the detector is \(T\). After interaction,
  applying the projective measurement of the postion \(q\) by the rest
  of the detector with the result \(q'\) yields the probability to obtain
  the outcome \(q'\)
  \[
  P(q')=\langle\phi|\langle\psi(0)|U^{\dagger}(T)|q'\rangle\langle q'|U(T)|\psi(0)\rangle|\phi\rangle\,.
  \]
  Keeping only the terms up to the first-order in interaction strength
  \(\gamma\) we have
  \[
  P(q')\approx|\langle q'|\phi\rangle|^2
  +\frac{\mathrm{i}}{\hbar}\gamma\langle\phi|[p_{q},|q'\rangle\langle q']|\phi\rangle
  \int_0^T\langle\psi(t)|\hat{P}_a|\psi(t)\rangle\,\mathrm{d}t\,.
  \]
  The average of the post-measurement detector's coordinate \(q'\) is
  \[
  \langle q(T)\rangle=\int q'P(q')\,\mathrm{d}q'
  \approx\langle q\rangle
  +\frac{\mathrm{i}}{\hbar}\gamma\langle\phi|[p_q, q]|\phi\rangle
  \int_0^T\langle\psi(t)|\hat{P}_a|\psi(t)\rangle\,\mathrm{d}t
  =\langle q\rangle+\gamma\tau_{\mathrm{Dw}}(T)\,.
  \]
  Thus the dwell time can be determined from the shift of the average
  coordinate
  \[
  \tau_{\mathrm{Dw}}(T)=\frac{1}{\gamma}(\langle q(T)\rangle-\langle q\rangle)\,.
  \]
