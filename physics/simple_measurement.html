  State vector of a quantum system after a measurement has been performed is
  given by the <a href="quantum_postulates.html#measurement_postulate">measurement postulate</a>.
  According to this postulate the measuring device is described classicaly,
  thus the world is divided into quantum and classical parts. Let us
  investigate a quantum system interacting with a measuring device in more
  detail. The first steps in a measurement interaction occur at the level of
  the microscopic components of the macroscopic device. We will describe the
  microscopic component of the measuring device using quantum mechanics and the
  rest of the device classically, thus shifting the quantum-classical divide.
  </p>
  <p>
  The measurement is performed by coupling the quantum system with the
  detector. Let us consider the interaction of the quantum system with
  the microscopic part of the detector described by the Hamiltonian <a href="#1">[1]</a>
  \[
  H=\gamma p_q x\,,
  \]
  where \(x\) is the observable of the quantum system that is being measured,
  \(p_q\) is the momenum of the detector conjugate to the coordinate
  of the detector \(q\). A large parameter \(\gamma\) describes the strength
  of the interaction. The interaction Hamiltonian results in a shift
  of the detector's position \(q\). If the initial state of the detector
  is such that \(q\) is well defined, we can obtain the value of \(x\)
  by the final value of \(q\) after the interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
  If the wave function of the quantum system before the measurement
  is \(\psi(x)\), the detector is in the pure state \(\phi(q)\) then the
  initial state of system and the detector is
  \[
  \Psi(x,q)=\psi(x)\phi(q)\,.
  \]
  Assuming that the duration of the interaction is \(\tau\), after the
  interaction the state becomes
  \[
  \Psi'(x,q)=\exp\left(-\frac{\mathrm{i}}{\hbar}\gamma\tau p_{q}x\right)\Psi(x,q)=\psi(x)\phi(q-\gamma\tau x)\,.
  \]
  Applying the projective measurement of the postion \(q\) by the rest
  of the detector with the result \(q'\) yields the post-measurement
  wave fuction of the quantum system
  \[
  \psi(x;q')=\frac{1}{\sqrt{P(q')}}\psi(x)\phi(q'-\gamma\tau x)\,,
  \]
  where 
  \[
  P(q')=\int|\psi(x)|^2|\phi(q'-\gamma\tau x)|^2\,\mathrm{d}x
  \]
  is the probability to obtain the outcome \(q'\).
  </p>
  <p>
  If the initial wave function of the detector \(\phi\) is narrowly centered
  around \(q_0\), then the final wave function of the quantum system
  becomes centered around
  \[
  x'=\frac{1}{\gamma\tau}(q'-q_0)
  \]
  and the probability to obtain the measured quantity \(x'\) becomes
  \(P(x')=|\psi(x')|^2\). Thus after the shift of the quantum-classical
  boundary the changes of the wave function of the quantum system are the same
  as described by the measurement postulate. This result shows that the precise
  placement of quantum-classical divide is not important.
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, let us take the wave function of the detector as
  \[
  \phi(q)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}f\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}(q-q_0)\right)\,,
  \]
  where \(\epsilon\) is a small quantity describing the width of the
  detector's wave function and the function $f$ satisfies the condition
  \[
  \int|f(u)|^2\,\mathrm{d}u=1\,.
  \]
  In this situation the probability for outcome \(q'\) can be approximated
  as 
  \[
  P(q')\approx\frac{1}{\gamma\tau}|\psi(x')|^2
  \]
  and the probability to obtain the measured quantity \(x'\) is \(P(x')=\gamma\tau P(q')=|\psi(x')|^2\).
  The wave function of the quantum system after the measurement becomes
  \[
  \psi(x;x')=\frac{\psi(x)}{|\psi(x')|}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma\tau}{\epsilon}}f\left(\frac{\gamma\tau}{\epsilon}(x'-x)\right)\,.
  \]
  This is a function with a sharp peak around \(x=x'\). The finite width
  \(\epsilon\) of the detector's quantum state \(\phi\) results in an
  measurement error 
  \[
  \Delta x=\frac{\epsilon}{\gamma\tau}\,.
  \]
